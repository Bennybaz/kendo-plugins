# Kendo UI Plugins

# Note
Kendo UI Labs projects are experimental and largely built and supported by the community.  As such Telerik does not provide official support for any of the Kendo UI Labs projects via Telerik support agreements.  We do encourage you to open an issue or visit [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com).

## About Kendo Plugins

Kendo Plugins is a library of third party widgets and controls written for Kendo UI by the community.

## Compatibility and Requirements

Kendo Plugins in the Web, Mobile, DataViz and Framework folders depend on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.9.1
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com) 2013 Q1

Additionally, some plugins have other required resources and will be documented in the README.md file for each Plugin.

* **maps:** Requires the [Google Maps API library V3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)

Kendo Plugins for previous versions of Kendo UI and jQuery can be found in the Archive folder.  Troubleshooting will be provided for the current Kendo Plugins.

## Getting Help

As a part of Kendo UI Labs, Kendo Plugins are intended to be a community-run project, and not an official part of any Kendo UI SKU (Web, DataViz, Mobile or Complete). As such, this project is not a supported part of Kendo UI, and is not covered under the support agreements for Kendo UI license holders. Please do not create support requests for this project, as these will be immediately closed and you'll be directed to post your question on a community forum.
